# Let's Encrypt: Boulder cookbook

This is a cookbook for provisioning [Boulder][], an
[ACME-based][acme-spec] certificate authority, written in Go. The
Boulder application is an official effort of [Let's Encrypt
project][letsencrypt]. This particular cookbook is a fork of
[letsencrypt-boulder-server](https://github.com/patcon/chef-letsencrypt-boulder-server)
for use at the OSUOSL.

**Warning:** This cookbook was created for testing other cookbooks, not
production purposes.

## Supported Platforms

* CentOS 6
* CentOS 7

|`['boulder']['config']['issuer-ocsp-responder']`| Hash    | Deep-merged into [eponymous config file][config2]. |

## Recipes

### `default`

Install and starts the Boulder server.

## Notes

* Pay close attention to the output of any failed attempts. By default,
  Boulder tries to use all ports in the range 8000 to 8010, among
others. If there is a conflict with other applications, you can use this
cookbook's attributes to force Boulder onto a different port.

* If you're running the boulder server during testing, and it's on the
  same server as the webserver, you'll likely want to edit the
hostsfile. The [`hostfile` cookbook][hostsfile-ckbk] is great for this.

## Development

To tag and publish a new version of this cookbook, first ensure:

* the `metadata.rb` version has been bumped appropriately,
* the `CHANGELOG.md` has been updated, and
* all changes have been committed to git.

Once that has been done:

    bundle exec rake publish

This will create a git tag and push a new release to the Supermarket.
